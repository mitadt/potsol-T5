WHY?
We have been trying to target a social issue , which we can solve and play our part towards a bright future of the country.
The social issue we are addressing is POTHOLES. Our country suffers a lot due to potholes we have given a solution about the same.


HOW IT WORKS:
1) Firstly you login with pre-consisted values of admin id and username.
2) After you login the website , you can access the queries reported by the users through the application ( already developed ) , there is an section where you can see the users that regsitered through the application.
3) Also we can see the verified users , who helped by reporting the pothole issue.
4) There is an section to chang the password as well
5) We can logout the website ,which will exit you from accessing the website .
